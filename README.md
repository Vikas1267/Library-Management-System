📚 Library Management SystemA production-grade backend ecosystem for managing library operations. This system leverages Spring Boot 3.x and JWT-based authentication to provide a secure, scalable, and role-aware API environment.🚀 Key Features🔐 Security & Access ControlStateless JWT Authentication: Secure communication via Bearer tokens.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):ADMIN: Full CRUD capabilities, inventory management.MEMBER: Discovery (Search/Browse), borrowing, and returning.BCrypt Encryption: Industry-standard password hashing.📚 Inventory IntelligenceSmart Search: Filter by title or author with optimized queries.Availability Tracking: Real-time status updates for book stock.Conflict Prevention: Logic to prevent double-issuing or invalid returns.📄 Enterprise PatternsAdvanced Pagination: Powered by Spring Data PageRequest for high performance with large datasets.DTO Pattern: Decouples Database Entities from API Contracts to ensure security and flexibility.Global Exception Handling: Unified @ControllerAdvice for consistent error reporting.🏗️ Project ArchitectureThe project follows a Layered Architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns.Plaintextsrc/main/java/com/library/librarymanagement

🔐 Authentication FlowHandshake: Client sends credentials to /auth/login.Token Issuance: Server validates and returns a Signed JWT.Authorized Access: Client includes JWT in the Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> header.Verification: Custom JwtFilter intercepts requests to validate claims and roles.📌 API Reference🔑 AuthenticationMethodEndpointDescriptionPOST/auth/loginReturns JWT token upon valid credentials📚 Book ManagementMethodEndpointAccessDescriptionPOST/booksAdminRegister a new book in the catalogGET/booksAllPaginated list (e.g., ?page=0&size=5)GET/books/searchAllQuery by title or author🔄 TransactionsMethodEndpointAccessDescriptionPOST/books/issueMemberAssign a book to the current userPOST/books/return/{id}MemberProcess book return by ID🧪 Request ExamplesLogin RequestPOST /auth/loginJSON{

❗ Error HandlingThe system uses a Global Exception Handler to return meaningful, structured JSON errors instead of messy stack traces.ScenarioHTTP StatusMessageBook not found404 Not Found"Book with ID [X] does not exist"Already Issued400 Bad Request"This book is currently unavailable"Unauthorized403 Forbidden"Access Denied: Admin rights required"🛠️ Tech StackBackend: Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring SecurityPersistence: Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, MySQLSecurity: JJWT (Java JWT)Build Tool: Maven📈 Why This Project?This repository is built to demonstrate Senior-level Backend Proficiency:Scalability: Implementation of Pagination ensures the UI never hangs.Security: Prevents common vulnerabilities through Spring Security.Maintainability: Clean code principles and DTO mapping.🧠 Roadmap & Future Enhancements[ ] Dockerization: Containerize MySQL and the Spring app.[ ] API Documentation: Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI UI.[ ] Email Notifications: Alert users when a book is overdue.[ ] Unit Testing: Achieve 80%+ coverage with JUnit 5 & Mockito.👨‍💻 AuthorOmvikasJava Backend Engineer
